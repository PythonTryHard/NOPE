Let's face it: [Your company is losing money](https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/6#issuecomment-2374799784), technical debt is piling up, and you [cannot be arsed](https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/102#issuecomment-2374886922) into [hiring](https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/24) a [lawyer](https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/16#issuecomment-2372071281) because your company is losing money and technical debt is piling up. Your Head of Software Development (or what-have-you) came to you with a brilliant idea: Open-source the thing. There are tons of [people out there writing code for free](https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/6#issuecomment-2371719733), [why not let them do it](https://github.com/WinampDesktop/winamp/issues/6#issuecomment-2371714183)? Besides, not like your software is worth monetising; heck, it's free! Free software, free source code, something-something, profit!
