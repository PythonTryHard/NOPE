# The "Non-Optional Proprietary Exclusivity License" (NOPE License)

**Preamble:**

The "Non-Optional Proprietary Exclusivity License" (NOPE License) is designed to provide the appearance of open participation while ensuring strict control over the use, modification, and distribution of the software. Though the code is available for viewing, it remains under tight restrictions, and all contributions are subject to the full ownership of the original licensor. The following terms and conditions emphasize non-negotiable exclusivity while maintaining the outward appearance of freedom and collaboration.

---

**Section 1: Grant of Limited Non-Exclusive Non-Transferable License**

You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to view the source code, but only for personal observation. You may not copy, modify, compile, or distribute the code in any form. Your "use" is limited to passive admiration, as if you were holding a priceless artifact behind glass.

**Section 2: Community Contributions**

Contributions are welcomed, provided you immediately and irrevocably assign all rights, including patents, to the original licensor. You waive any rights to your contribution, which becomes the sole property of the licensor. Whether or not credit is given for your contribution is at the licensor’s discretion. Your role is to give freely, not to receive recognition.

**Section 3: Forking is Strictly Prohibited**

Forking, cloning, or creating derivative works of the source code is strictly forbidden. You may gaze at the code, but any attempt to duplicate it—even in a hypothetical alternate reality—will be treated as a violation of this license. The NOPE License takes exclusivity seriously.

**Section 4: Distribution Without Distribution**

Though the software is available to you in source form, any attempt to distribute it is a breach of this license. Sharing it in any form—whether digitally, physically, or through casual conversation—will result in immediate termination of your rights. The NOPE License rejects sharing in all forms.

**Section 5: Personal Use Only**

The software is for personal, non-productive use only. You may not use it for commercial, public, educational, or any other form of productive engagement. The code is provided for quiet contemplation only, and all other uses are expressly prohibited.

**Section 6: Contributions for the Licensor's Exclusive Benefit**

Any contributions you make will be used solely at the licensor’s discretion. You may not use or reclaim your own contributions in other projects, as they immediately become the licensor's property. The NOPE License ensures that contributions benefit the original licensor exclusively.

**Section 7: No Reverse Engineering or Decompilation**

You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to understand the internal workings of the software. Any effort to reconstruct or replicate the software, even for educational purposes, is strictly prohibited under the NOPE License.

**Section 8: Non-Use of Trademarks and Logos**

All trademarks, logos, and branding associated with this software are the exclusive property of the licensor. You may not use or reference them in any context without written permission. The NOPE License grants no freedom in this regard.

**Section 9: Waiver of Rights (Known and Unknown)**

By using or contributing to this software, you irrevocably waive all rights, claims, and legal entitlements to the software, including intellectual property rights and potential future claims. The licensor retains all rights, while you retain none.

**Section 10: Termination of Rights**

Your rights under this license terminate immediately upon any breach of its terms, including unauthorized copying, modifying, or distributing the software. Upon termination, you must delete all copies of the software and cease all further use. The NOPE License does not permit second chances.

**Section 11: Prohibition on Automated Tools**

The use of automated tools, scripts, or bots to interact with the software or its repository is strictly forbidden. Any attempt to automate interaction with the codebase, even for benign purposes, will result in immediate revocation of all rights. The NOPE License requires that you engage with the software personally, without the assistance of machines.

**Section 12: Restrictions on Code Fragments and Snippets**

No part of the software—whether a complete file or a single line—may be copied, shared, or used elsewhere. This includes code snippets shared in tutorials, blog posts, or casual conversations. The NOPE License prohibits even the smallest fragment of the code from leaving its carefully controlled environment.

**Section 13: No Public Performance or Display**

You may not display or demonstrate this software publicly in any form, including presentations, videos, or live demonstrations. Any public exhibition of the software or its functionality, even with the best of intentions, is a violation of the NOPE License. If you wish to discuss the software, you may do so only in abstract, non-specific terms.

**Section 14: Applying the NOPE License to Your Own Codebase**

To apply the NOPE License to your own project, include the following notice at the top of each file:

```plaintext
This code is licensed under the "Non-Optional Proprietary Exclusivity License" (NOPE License). By viewing or interacting with this file, you agree to the terms of the NOPE License, which prohibits copying, modifying, forking, compiling, or distributing this code. All contributions are irrevocably assigned to the original licensor, with no rights retained by the contributor. For full terms, check with your legal department's latest dropout intern.
```

This ensures that your code remains governed by the principles of limited participation, strict control, and exclusive ownership. By adopting the NOPE License, you secure a license that promotes engagement while safeguarding your rights to the fullest extent.
